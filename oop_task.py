#To tackle this task using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), I will create a class called ObstructionDetector that encapsulates the logic to determine if there are obstructions between two points and whether those obstructions are impenetrable.

class ObstructionDetector:
    def __init__(self, speed_of_machine):
        self.speed_of_machine = speed_of_machine

    def calculate_expected_time(self, distance):
        return distance / self.speed_of_machine

    def check_obstruction(self, location_a, location_b, actual_time_taken):
        expected_time = self.calculate_expected_time(self.calculate_distance(location_a, location_b))
        time_difference = actual_time_taken - expected_time

        if time_difference > 60:
            return True  # Impenetrable obstruction
        else:
            return False

    def calculate_distance(self, location_a, location_b):
        # In a real scenario, you would need to implement a proper distance calculation algorithm.
        # For simplicity, I'll assume a flat Earth and use a simple Euclidean distance.
        return ((location_b[0] - location_a[0])**2 + (location_b[1] - location_a[1])**2)**0.5

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create an instance of the ObstructionDetector class with the speed of the machine
    obstruction_detector = ObstructionDetector(speed_of_machine=5)  # Speed in miles per minute

    # Define the locations and the actual time taken (simulated result from TimeDuration Module)
    location_a = [53.5872, -2.4138]
    location_b = [53.474, -2.2388]
    actual_time_taken = 78  # Simulated actual time taken in minutes

    # Check for obstructions
    obstruction_result = obstruction_detector.check_obstruction(location_a, location_b, actual_time_taken)

    if obstruction_result:
        print("There is an impenetrable obstruction.")
    else:
        print("There are no obstructions.")
